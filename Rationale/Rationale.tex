	\section*{Overview}
	
	The Philippines is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, making careful planning essential for evacuating victims. Allocating shelters requires careful consideration, taking into account factors such as the distance from communities to shelters, the cost of maintaining the shelters, and the distance from workplaces in the area. Existing models that address these considerations can be solved using a genetic algorithm (GA), which necessitates the development of a computer program. This paper discusses these existing models and focuses on creating a computer program to solve them, followed by simulating the models in the Hagonoy area.
