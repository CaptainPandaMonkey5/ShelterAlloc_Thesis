\section{Objective of the Study}

The primary objective of this study is to develop an efficient Decision Support System (DSS) for optimal shelter allocation in disaster situations, specifically designed for the municipality of Hagonoy. The specific goals of the study are to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Formulate a suitable model for shelter allocation in disaster situations.
	\item Solve the model using genetic algorithm.
	\item Develop a DSS integrating the formulated model and its solution.
\end{enumerate}
