\section{Objective of the Study}

The primary objective of this study is to develop an efficient Decision Support System (DSS) for optimal shelter allocation in disaster situations, specifically designed for the municipality of Hagonoy. The specific goals of the study are to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Model Formulation}: Formulate a suitable model, using the Bilevel No Transfer model derived from the General Single Level model (GEN) and Hierarchical model (HIER) for shelter allocation in disaster situations. The model should showcase the minimization of travel distance, and cost of the shelter construction or maintenance. Also, prove that the solution in the formulated model exists and is feasible.
	
	\item \textbf{System Development}: Develop a DSS integrating the formulated model, and solving the model using Genetic Algorithm. The system should produce an output containing the optimal shelter allocation of the municipality by integrating the formulated model. The user of the system should also have access to modify the data, tag the shelters, and secure the data.
	
	\item \textbf{System Assessment}: The acceptability of the proposed system will be determined by a survey based on the criteria of ISO/IEC 25010. This will be given to the potential users of the system such as the administrators in disaster risk reduction management.
