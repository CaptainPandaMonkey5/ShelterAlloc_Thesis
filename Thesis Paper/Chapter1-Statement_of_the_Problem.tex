\section{Statement of the Problem}

This study aims to address the shelter allocation problem for the municipality of Hagonoy, particularly during disaster situations such as during storm surge and flash flood. The primary challenge is how to model and solve this location-allocation problem to ensure that victims are allocated to shelters in an optimal manner. Specifically, the paper aims to solve the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How to model the shelter allocation problem taking considerations of :
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Distance from a community to a shelter
		\item Cost of maintaining/constructing a shelter
		\item Capacity of a shelter
	\end{enumerate}
	\item How to solve the formulated model?
	\item What is the optimal shelter allocation for the municipality of Hagonoy?
\end{enumerate}
